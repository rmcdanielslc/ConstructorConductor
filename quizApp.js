//We're going to create the JS for a basic quiz application.

//Let's think about the nature of this quiz app first. We're going to be creating lots of user objects, and we're
//also going to be creating lots of Question objects. Those would make two perfectly good constructors.

//Create a QuizUser constructor that accepts name, email, password, and totalScore parameters and set them appropriatly

  function QuizUser(name, email, password, totalScore) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
    this.totalScore = totalScore;
  }


//Create a Question constructor that accepts title, answersArray, rightAnswer, and difficulty parameters

  function Question(title, answersArray, rightAnswer, difficulty) {
    this.title = title;
    this.answersArray = answersArray;
    this.rightAnswer = rightAnswer;
    this.difficulty = difficulty;
  }


//Create a quizUsers Array which is going to hold all of our users.

  var quizUsers = [];


//Let's say three people signed up for our service, create 3 instances of User and add each to the users Array

  var user1 = new User('Ryan', 'ryanslc@', 'slc')
  var user2 = new User('Bren', 'brenslc@', 'aaa')
  var user3 = new User('Kris', 'Krisslc@', 'bbb')

  quizUsers.push(user1, user2, user3)


//Create a questions Array which is going to hold all of our questions

  var questions = [];


//Now, let's say we wanted to create a quiz about JavaScript. Create three instances of Question which contain the following data
//title: 'T/F: Inheritance is achieved in JavaScript through Prototypes?'
//title: 'T/F: JavaScript is just a scripting version of Java'
//title: "T/F: In Javascript, == doesn't check 'type' but just the value - where === checks type and value"
//Fill in the rest of the required data as you see appropriate.

  //code here


//Now push all of your instances of Question into the questions Array

  //code here

console.log('My users Array and my questions arrray are ...');
//Now loop console.log your users array and your questions array and verify that they're both holding the right data.

  //code here
